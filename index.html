        Happy birthday Miranda!!! Iâ€™m so happy that we met on admitted students
        day and continued to be friends through the year. Thanks for being my
        buddy and going to random events and getting me out of my room I had a
        lot of fun! Iâ€™m excited to see you again this august!

        Hello Miranda. My sincerest congratulations on your day of birth. Hope
        19 is drastically different than 18 and you make lots of fun new
        memories in Ohio and in Minnesota. Can't wait to sit in more airports
        with you. Sasha, signing off.

        Hi Miranda! I know weâ€™ve just hung out a few times through Katey and
        Sasha, but every time Iâ€™ve talked to you, youâ€™ve made me feel so
        welcomed and included. Even in groups where people do not know each
        other that well, you always make sure no one feels left out. You are a
        very interesting and smart person, and I hope you have a great birthday!
      </p>

        Happy Birthday Miranda!!!! Iâ€™m so glad to have met you. You bring me so
        much joy. I genuinely donâ€™t think I would have made it through countless
        mandatory WIB events without you. I appreciated the study sessions
        during finals week and bitching about how bad the rush process was late
        into the night. Thanks for being my sorta sober buddy at the frats and
        also for being my bit of home away from home in the form of a gorgeous
        midwestern princess. Anyway, party hardy!!!! Hope you have the best day!
        Canâ€™t wait to see you again in August!

        Aaaaaah Miranda. It was so great meeting you last year. We've had this
        conversation before but for the suprisingly short time I've known you,
        it has felt a lot longer. It has been swell getting to be your friend.
        Here's to a great birthday and next year of school.
